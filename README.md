# CyberThreat Response Predictor 🚨⏱️  
*A machine learning tool that predicts incident resolution time for cybersecurity attacks*
<br>
<br>
Every minute counts when responding to a cyberattack. Our AI tool, predicts how long it will take to resolve security breaches—helping companies save millions in downtime.
<br>
<br>
We analyzed over 3,000 real attacks, from ransomware to phishing, and identified key patterns in response times. While our current model is a starting point, we’re refining it to be the ultimate tool for IT teams.
<br>
<br>
Imagine knowing in advance whether an attack will take hours or days to fix. That’s the future we’re building!


## 📌 Overview  
In a world where cyberattacks cost millions per hour, our team built a predictive model that estimates **how long it will take to resolve a cybersecurity incident** based on:  
- Attack type (Ransomware, Phishing, etc.)  
- Target industry (Healthcare, Finance, etc.)  
- Defense mechanisms used  
- Financial impact  

**Impact**: Helps organizations allocate resources faster and minimize downtime.
